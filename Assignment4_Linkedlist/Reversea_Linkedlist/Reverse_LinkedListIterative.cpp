/*
Explanation:

Headers: #include <iostream> includes the header for input/output operations.
Node structure: Defines the Node structure with data and next members.
reverseList function:
Initialization:
prev starts as nullptr since it will point to the new head (last node).
current starts at the original head.
next is used temporarily to store the next node before overwriting its link.
Loop:
while (current != nullptr): Continues until the end of the list.
Inside the loop:
next = current->next;: Stores the next node as it will be lost after reversing the link.
current->next = prev;: Reverses the link by pointing the current node's next to the previous node.
prev = current;: Updates the previous pointer to point to the current node (new last node).
current = next;: Moves the current pointer to the stored next node for the next iteration.
Return:
return prev;: Returns the prev pointer, which now points to the last node (new head).
main function:
Creates a sample linked list.
Calls reverseList to reverse the list and updates the head pointer.
Prints the reversed list.
Deallocates memory used by the linked list to avoid leaks.
