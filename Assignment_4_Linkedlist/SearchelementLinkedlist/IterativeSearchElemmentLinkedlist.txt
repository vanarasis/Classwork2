The iterative method for searching an element in a linked list is both straightforward and efficient.

Initialization:
Commence with a pointer variable named "current" pointing to the head of the linked list.
Define a variable, denoted as "target," to store the element you wish to find.

Iterate Through the List:
Continue iterating while the "current" pointer is not NULL (indicating the end of the list hasn't been reached):
Compare the data stored in the current node, pointed to by "current," with the target element.
If a match is found, the element has been located! End the loop and return a success signal (e.g., true) or the node itself if necessary.
If no match is found, move to the next node in the list by updating "current" to point to "current->next".

Incomplete Search:
If the loop concludes without finding the element (when "current" becomes NULL), it indicates that the element isn't present in the list. Provide a failure indication (e.g., false).

Key Observations:
This technique systematically traverses the list, examining each node's data against the target element.
The time complexity is O(n), where "n" denotes the number of nodes in the list, since all nodes might need to be visited in the worst-case scenario.
Only a constant amount of extra space is necessary for the pointers and variables.
It's generally preferred over the recursive approach due to its iterative nature and superior memory efficiency.

Additional Insights:
Depending on the implementation, the function might return the position of the element instead of a mere success/failure flag.
Some variations, such as the "move-to-front" strategy, involve optimizations like relocating the found element to the head of the list to expedite future accesses.
