/*
The recursive approach addresses the task of determining the length of the entire list by breaking it down into finding the length of smaller sub-lists. The logic unfolds as follows:

Base case: If the current node is null (indicating the end of the list), the length is 0. Return 0.
Recursive call: Otherwise, initiate a recursive call to determine the length of the remaining list starting from the next node.
Increment by 1: Add 1 to the result obtained from the recursive call since it represents the length of the remaining list, and the current node itself contributes 1 to the overall length.
Return: Provide the sum (1 + length of the remaining list).
Termination conditions:

The recursion halts when the base case is encountered, indicating that the current node is null.

/*Explanation:

#include <iostream>: This statement includes the header for input/output operations.
Node structure: Defines the Node structure with data and next members.
recursiveLength function:
if (head == nullptr): Base case: if the current node is null (end of list), its length is 0, so return 0.
else: Recursive case:
return 1 + recursiveLength(head->next): Initiates a recursive call to determine the length of the remaining list (starting from the next node) and adds 1 to it, accounting for the current node as well.
main function:
Sample linked list: Generates a sample list with nodes containing values 1, 2, 3, and 4.
Calculate length: Calls the recursiveLength function with the head pointer to find the length and stores it in listLength.
Print length: Outputs the length to the console.
Memory deallocation: Similar to the iterative approach, frees memory utilized by the linked list to prevent memory leaks.
